# Archived

- This was a fork of [Muon](https://github.com/brave/muon/)-based Brave with our early experiments.
 - Brave [switched to Chromium in 2018](https://web.archive.org/web/20181017002230/https://brave.com/development-plans-for-upcoming-release/) and [IPFS Companion](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-companion/) is now fully compatible with it.
- Future native IPFS Integration (roadmap/discussion) is tracked in [brave/brave-browser/issues/819](https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/issues/819)
